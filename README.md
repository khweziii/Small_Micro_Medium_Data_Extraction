The purpose of this repository is to extract data from PDF files that were downloaded from the STATS SA website. These PDFs contain data on income, employment and market dominance data 
on the food and beverages industry in South Africa (from 2007 till 2022). There are python scripts that extract matrices for Income data and Market Dominanace data, then there's a
program that takes the data frames and exports them into excel files, that are then read into PowerBI and used to create the final visualizations.
